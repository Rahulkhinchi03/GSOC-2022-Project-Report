# About Me
 Iâ€™m a Rising Junior pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering. I will be graduating in 2024. My aim is to become a T-Shaped Developer (Design, Develop, Test, Deploy). I am leading technical communities like GitHub Campus Expert, Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors, and Google Developers Student Club.

# Primary Goals of the Project

- Maintaining the project without the last human factor point.

## Project type: Infrastructure improvement 

In our project CI process is already set in code and everyone can see it and propose changes for it. But we still have the release process 80% automated; unfortunately, it depends on 1 person to do this. The release process takes a bit of time to complete that is why we have the release process set in "ones a month" but in reality, we are ready to release at any point of time from any commit, as our development process already implies this. The release process focuses on delivery detail to users rather than just bumping a version and sharing jars. So we focus on release note generation to share all details with users and share it at web hostings and social media. The release process requires a lot of actions from a certain person who has admin access to websites/hosts and other accounts to make a release.

The goal of this project is to finish automation to let any person with Read-Write access in GitHub do release by activation of CI execution. The release process should be in scripts/code of our repo(s) to let all see what is going on and even is required to release manually in case CI is experiencing downtime or any other problems.

Completion of this project will help us to increase the frequency of releases if required to make sure that users can receive the released version to use almost right after code changes are merged into the main code base. It will make a contribution to the project more attractive as it will be apparent that as soon as a code change is accepted you can use it in a project where you are experiencing problems with defects. The frequency of releases will be defined later on and probably be based on the severity of fixed defects, contributors can share with us how much they ok to wait for the release.

## A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF MY WORK

### Community Bonding Period

- Understanding the current release process.
- Explored releasenotes-builder, a checkstyle tool for generating all the needful things for release.
- Interacted with Mentor to understand the scope of the project.
- Worked on the skills needed for the Project.

#### Release Process: [BEFORE](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/wiki/How-to-make-a-release) and [AFTER](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/wiki/Semi-automated-release) Summer!

### Further steps:

- My experience with GSoC was great, and I plan on staying here and enjoying the open-source culture. I met some really good mentors and organizers. That being said, I think I got the essence of what GSoC was intended for. Opensource is my favorite way to do work!
